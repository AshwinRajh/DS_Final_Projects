# DS_Final_Projects

As a data science enthusiast, I successfully completed three impactful projects that showcase my growing expertise in machine learning and predictive analytics. In the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, I crafted a robust machine learning model to enhance the precision of identifying fraudulent transactions. This not only strengthened financial security but also deepened my understanding of model evaluation and fine-tuning.

The Absenteeism at Work Prediction project, aimed at predicting employee absenteeism, allowed me to delve into predictive modeling, conducting feature importance analysis to identify key contributors to absenteeism. This project equipped me with valuable insights into workforce planning and highlighted the significance of proactive absence management for organizational efficiency.

Lastly, in the Revenue Prediction project, I utilized regression models and predictive analytics to forecast future revenue, considering diverse factors. This project enhanced my skills in feature engineering and provided businesses with actionable insights for strategic planning and revenue optimization. These projects collectively demonstrate my commitment to applying data science methodologies to real-world scenarios and my continuous journey of refining my skills in the field.
